## Implementation Details

### Hierarchical Control Architecture

This project implements a sophisticated two-level control system that separates strategic decision-making from precise motion execution:

#### 1. High-Level SAC Controller (`sac_pick_place_trainer.py`)
**Strategic Decision Making:**
- **Input:** Multi-modal state representation (42D) combining joint kinematics, visual perception, and task context
- **Output:** High-level control commands for task phase transitions and strategic decisions
- **Purpose:** Learns optimal sequencing of manipulation phases (approach → grasp → transport → place)

**State Representation (42D):**
- Joint states (14D): 7 joint positions + 7 joint velocities
- Object detection (20D): 4 objects × 5 features (x, y, height, color, confidence)
